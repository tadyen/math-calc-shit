# Euler constant

This section is about the euler number `e ~ 2.71828`

This is NOT to be confused with the euler-*macceroni* constant and all other euler things because euler is the math GOAT with more than enough of his name to things.

## bruh this is like 200++ year old maths everyone knows about

yeah and?

## so why?

Because sandboxing why not? eg. School introduces **e** is some magic number where $\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$ but we usually never really bat an eye more than that.

In uni level maths and beyond, e can be expressed as an infinite product, infinite sum, infinite fraction, etc.

eg.

Taylor-Maclauren series:

$ e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + ... = \sum^\infty_{n=0}\frac{x^n}{n!}$

amongst others

It's far from hands on and enters the realm of abstraction.

If asked for a *numerically computed* way of calculating e, it's usually via one of these infinite expressions which comes from an *analytical solution*.

It's never from first principals (for good reasons tbh).

However this also draws inspiration from how one can calculate $\pi$ numerically using an integral:

$\frac{\pi^2}{4} = \int^1_0 \sqrt{1 - x^2}{dx}$

which is simply the integral(area) of a unit circle in one quadrant. It's hard to obtain an analytical solution but easy to numerically compute.

This is actually a common exercise thrown at maths and cs students.

However the same treatment isn't exactly thought nor discussed with other common math constants so this is why I am sandboxxing this.
